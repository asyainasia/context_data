Interviewer: Привет! Thanks for being here today. Can you share your experience as a recruiter in Russia, especially regarding the platforms you use?

Interviewee: Привет! Absolutely. I mainly utilize hh.ru, making use of all available promotion options on the site.

Interviewer: Great choice. Can you walk us through your work process?

Interviewee: Certainly. I use the Huntflow platform and manually add all candidates through a browser extension. The shared database allows communication with candidates who've interacted with other recruiters. I preferentially select new candidates for each vacancy, discarding unresponsive candidates within three days. Communication channels include call/email, with occasional use of WhatsApp. After the initial phone interview, I communicate with candidates via email and use WhatsApp for those without email details.

Interviewer: Interesting workflow. Any insights you've gained from your experience?

Interviewee: My focus is primarily on full-time positions in Russia. I don't send feedback requests, and there's no internal blacklist. I make it a point to provide feedback promptly, typically on the day of the interview or test completion.

Interviewer: Efficient process. Moving on to pain points, what challenges have you faced?

Interviewee: Some candidates respond to irrelevant vacancies, which can be a bit frustrating. Additionally, some candidates do not respond to communication attempts, posing a challenge in the process.

Interviewer: Understandable challenges. Anything else you'd like to add or highlight?

Interviewee: Just emphasizing the importance of effective communication and responsiveness in the recruitment process.

Interviewer: Absolutely. Your insights are valuable. Thanks for being open and sharing your experiences with us today.
