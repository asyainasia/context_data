Interviewer: Guten Tag! Thanks for being here today. Can you share your experience with recruitment platforms as an HR professional with recruiter functions in Switzerland?

Interviewee: Guten Tag! Absolutely. I primarily use LinkedIn and Indeed.com for recruitment purposes.

Interviewer: Great choices. Now, could you walk us through your work process when it comes to recruitment?

Interviewee: Sure thing. I collaborate with selected agencies, with established contracts and communication principles in place. We use agencies for managerial positions, while I handle the search for line positions. Part-time staff comes in on temporary contracts with additional pay. I manually review all applications, don't use CRM, and don't return to the candidate pool. Communication typically starts with email or chat, followed by a call and then WhatsApp. I emphasize checking work permits, and on average, it takes one to two months to fill a position.

Interviewer: Interesting approach. Any particular insights you've gained from your experience?

Interviewee: Absolutely. I independently analyze candidates and can be a bit skeptical of agency recommendations. Agencies tend to provide minimal information; company details are usually shared during in-house interviews.

Interviewer: Got it. Moving on to pain points, what challenges have you faced?

Interviewee: Unfortunately, I had a negative experience in Russia with a lack of feedback for 90% of applications. Dealing with duplicated submissions has been frustrating, leading me to maintain a blacklist. It's also challenging to assess candidates early on to avoid investing in training only to part ways later.

Interviewer: Tough challenges indeed. Anything else you'd like to add or highlight?

Interviewee: Just the importance of transparent communication and the need for more efficient early assessments to streamline the hiring process.

Interviewer: Absolutely. Your insights are valuable. Thanks for being open and sharing your experiences with us today.
