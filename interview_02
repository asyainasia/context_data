Interviewer: Hey there! Thanks for being with us today. Can you kick things off by sharing your experience with recruiters during your vet job search in London?

Interviewee: Hey! Sure thing. Dealing with recruiters was a bit tricky. Some had unclear identities, and I even encountered a few who weren't registered. Transparency was a big issue, with some of them hiding their company details. It got confusing when I initially thought the recruiter was part of the practice.

Interviewer: That sounds tough. Can you tell us about the platforms you used during your job search?

Interviewee: Oh, definitely. I mostly relied on Facebook to sidestep recruiters. Building on personal connections was key, leveraging recommendations from people I knew.

Interviewer: Interesting strategy. What specific help did you need during your job search?

Interviewee: I needed assistance gathering info for relocation, and getting answers about the local climate was crucial.

Interviewer: Moving on to your feelings during the process, how did that go?

Interviewee: It was a rollercoaster, mostly on the negative side. Transparency issues, commission-based recruiting, dishonest job descriptions, and agencies taking advantage of inexperienced graduates really made it challenging.

Interviewer: Tough journey. Anything else you want to add or highlight?

Interviewee: Just want to emphasize how crucial transparency is in this process. It makes a huge difference in the overall experience.

Interviewer: Absolutely. Your insights are valuable. Thanks for being open and sharing your experiences with us today.
