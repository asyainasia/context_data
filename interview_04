Interviewer: Ahoy! Thanks for joining us today. Can you share your experience with recruiters as a sailor and shift worker?

Interviewee: Hey there! Sure thing. I prefer email communication and occasionally answer post-application calls. I tend to disregard recruiter advice, relying on my experience. I'm familiar with the hiring process - recruiter call, manager interview, and ship commander interview. For any queries, I direct them to the onshore manager or ship commander. Unfortunately, no feedback is provided despite reminders, and quick responses are needed due to urgent postings.

Interviewer: Sounds like a unique process. What platforms do you use for your job searches?

Interviewee: I mainly use crewing websites for job searches, not LinkedIn. My LinkedIn profile is filled, but I don't use it for applications.

Interviewer: Interesting approach. Moving on to pain points, what challenges have you encountered?

Interviewee: One major challenge is the lack of a unified job aggregator. I have to visit each site individually. I wish there was an app for centralized job browsing during downtime. The onboarding process can be lacking, leading to a sense of being lost initially. I appreciate additional instructions.

Interviewer: That makes sense. Any particular habits you've developed in your job search?

Interviewee: I stick to a desktop-based job search. I'm self-sufficient in understanding industry trends and pay. I tend to minimize communication with other candidates.

Interviewer: Thanks for sharing those insights. Anything else you'd like to add or highlight?

Interviewee: Just emphasizing the need for better onboarding processes and a centralized job aggregator. It would make life at sea a bit smoother.

Interviewer: Absolutely. Your insights are valuable. Thanks for being open and sharing your experiences with us today.
