Interviewer: Welcome! Thank you for joining us today. Could you start by sharing how you found your current job as a nanny in Russia?

Interviewee: Hi! Sure, I found the job through an agency. It took about a month of active searching, interacting with multiple agencies, and occasionally dealing with overlapping opportunities.

Interviewer: Interesting. Could you elaborate on the communication channels you used during the job search?

Interviewee: Definitely. I received 1-2 job offers weekly via WhatsApp, which was quite convenient. I also contacted recruiters for clarifications, and they were prompt in their responses.

Interviewer: Great to hear. How about the process of starting work? Did you face any challenges there?

Interviewee: Families often took several weeks to decide. Traveling to another city for work took a few days, and I'm flexible about potential waiting time if needed, usually 1-2 weeks.

Interviewer: That sounds flexible. Moving on to pain points, how would you describe your overall experience, and were there any challenges?

Interviewee: Overall positive, but I wished for more independent vacancy browsing. Encountered some outdated listings on websites like hh.ru, leading to agencies. I usually used Google and Instagram for searches, as I prefer viewing vacancies on a larger screen.

Interviewer: Interesting approach. Can you share more about the challenges you faced during the search?

Interviewee: Dealing with outdated listings was a bit frustrating. Also, I prefer not to install apps due to memory concerns, so I had to find alternative ways to search.

Interviewer: Got it. Thanks for sharing. Any final thoughts or anything else you'd like to add?

Interviewee: Just that it's been a learning experience, and I appreciate the opportunity to share my insights.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your valuable experiences with us. We appreciate your time.
