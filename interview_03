Interviewer: Hello! Thanks for being here today. Can you start by sharing your experience with recruiters and agencies during your job search as a nurse in London?

Interviewee: Hi! Of course. Initially, I engaged with agency recruiters via LinkedIn or email. The communication typically started with emails or LinkedIn chats, followed by a phone interview. However, recruiters often disappeared, leaving me unsure if my messages or CVs were even received, and the outcomes were uncertain.

Interviewer: That sounds challenging. Can you tell us about the platforms you used during your job search?

Interviewee: Certainly. I primarily used LinkedIn, but I never responded to job offers I received through the platform.

Interviewer: Got it. Moving on to pain points, what challenges did you face during your job search?

Interviewee: Recruiters lacked competence and often sent irrelevant job offers. The real frustration came when recruiters vanished post-interview, providing no feedback.

Interviewer: Tough situation. Any insights or observations you gained from this experience?

Interviewee: Absolutely. Recruiters often omitted company names in interview invitations, which felt like a waste of time. My only successful interactions were with "internal" recruiters. I preferred communication with them, as interactions with "external" recruiters proved disappointing.

Interviewer: Thanks for sharing those insights. Anything else you want to add or highlight?

Interviewee: Just to stress the importance of competent and transparent communication in the recruitment process. It can make a huge difference.

Interviewer: Absolutely. Your insights are valuable. Thanks for being open and sharing your experiences with us today.
